January 4, 2005: Simon Freiberg <fryboy AT optusnet DOT com DOT au>
    * Add man page.

January 4, 2005: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Bug fixes: Don't crash on mt-daapd servers. Properly remove songs
    from partyshuffle when a host disappears.
    * Add debugging support: Pass debug flags to libopendaap
    * Many interface improvements: Mostly to do with party shuffle
    and other ways of playing songs.
    * Report more errors: Better handling and reporting of errors.
    * Drag and Drop of artists and albums.

December 17, 2004: Daniel Drake <dsd AT gentoo DOT org>
    * Reimplement play and pause button functionallity.

December 16, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Huge restrcture and rewrite: Rewrote daap.c to be much
    cleaner, the lists now interact with it on more of a 'pull'
    basis than a push basis, requesting info from it rather than
    being sent info. This allows me to add more UI features without
    hassling too much with daap.c. There are still some dirty hacks,
    like the source of playing isn't abstract, etc.
    * Create an entirely new gstreamer pipeline each song: Hopefully
    this should work around that nasty bug. Not sure though.
    * Much improved Party Shuffle feature: It actually somewhat works
    now! You can drag and drop files from the main songlist to the party
    list (generally the button) and move them around there. You can drag
    songs from any source.
    * Add gnome support and the ability to play local files: Entirely
    optional, if gnome is found. This feature allows one to drag
    and drop files from gnome (or rhythmbox, etc) into Party Shuffle
    for local play.

December 13, 2004: Daniel Drake <dsd AT gentoo DOT org>
    * Fix a tonne of compiler warnings.

December 13, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Fix several audioplayer issues: Use the new async queue for
    everything, hopefully work around a bug in the spider blugin.
    * Watch for iTunes updates: Currently not very useful, as we
    we don't do anything with the updates. But we now install a
    liopendaap update handler to ensure our connection doesn't drop.
    * Fix sorting bugs that appear in newer version of GTK.
    * Further work on the PartyShuffle feature: Including DND from
    the standard song list to the party shuffle list, displaying the
    party shuffle list, and so on. Use a toggle for the party shuffle
    selection, rather than a source entry as I can't figure out how
    to drop to a tree list item.

November 22, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Colour code connections: Add a red icon icon and use it for
    not connected servers, blue is connected.
    * Restructure some gstreamer calls: The stopping of songs and
    playing of 'next song' code has undergone major re-working.
    should be much more stable.

November 8, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Can now connect to mt-daapd servers.
    * Fix sorting regression.

November 2, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Add sort by disc: Songlist is now sorted by disc number before
    track number

October 31, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * gstreamer 0.8: Add support for gstreamer 0.8. Still maintain
    and prefer 0.6, as it is better tested.
    * gstreamer API usage bugs: Call most gstreamer APIs during idle
    times. That is, when the gstreamer context is not current. This
    should work around some random freezes inside of gstreamer.
    * GUI improvements: Add icons for source type, currently playing
    song.
    * Initial work on Party Shuffle: Non-usable work done in an effort
    to implement a Party Shuffle feature.
    * Slightly better error handling.

October 31, 2004: Daniel Drake <dsd AT gentoo DOT org>
    * Fix crash on deleted host.

July 31, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Remove hosts from host list when they go away.
    * GUI engine design change: change the way the command queue
    is checked. Can't remember why I did this one, but it works.
    I think maybe something to do with it not working on windows
    using the old way.
    * Get the correct file based on songformat.

June 6, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Fix delayed start from slow computers: We now tell gstreamer
    to start playing the song when the download starts. Fixes a
    clock skew.

June 6, 2004: Beat Birkhofer <beat AT birkhofer DOT ch>
    * OS X fix: Try using the esd sound sink.

June 5, 2004: David Moore <dcm AT mit DOT edu>
    * Fix bug when rebuilding share list: Don't mess with hosts
    that are already in the host list.

April 29, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>
    * Update for iTunes 4.5: Support libopendaap 0.2.0.
    * Better support for multiple hosts: Fix some crashes.
    * Grey out unsupported buttons.

March 17, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>

    * Fix crash when trying to change the currently playing song:
    This still isn't the best solution to the problem. As we still
    wait until the entire file has been downloaded before continuing,
    but we just download as fast as possible and move on.
    * Try to use alsa or artsd sinks: Fallbacks of loading of
    the gstreamer element 'osssink' fails.
    * Report and exit on gstreamer errors: Instead of crashing inside
    gstreamer of one of the gstreamer elements failed to load, we
    report and exit.

March 10, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>

    * Use libopendaap 0.1.2
    * Use hosts in the source list: Instead of having a different
    source entry for each host database in the source list, we
    now use hosts - in order to prevent connecting to each one
    on startup. Unfortunately I don't know what to do if there
    is more than one database in a host.
    * Connect to hosts only when required: Hosts are now only
    connected to only when they are clicked on in the source
    list.

Feburary 29, 2004: David Hammerton <david AT crazney DOT net>

    * Initial release.
