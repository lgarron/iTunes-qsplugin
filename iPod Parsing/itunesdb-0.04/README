ABOUT

  itunesdb is a Tcl library for reading iTunesDB files.

  If you have an iPod, this library may be of use to you.  An iPod uses an
  iTunesDB file to store all information about its music and playlists.  Most
  importantly, iTunesDB associates song titles with files in the iPod's
  filesystem.

SAMPLE USAGE

  % package require itunesdb
  % set db [itunesdb /mnt/ipod/iPod_Control/iTunes/iTunesDB]
  % $db read tracks {puts "$artist - $title"
  % $db destroy
